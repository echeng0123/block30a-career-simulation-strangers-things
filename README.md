<h1>Career Simulation notes: PLEASE READ BEFORE OPENING SITE </h1>

<h3>YES THIS IS THE CORRECT BRANCH, not MAIN. TRY-7-HARDCODED-TOKEN (it actually uses redux, not a hardcoded token)</h3>

<h2>Notes on using the site: </h2>
<li>Try not to refresh the page because it will end your session. If you do refresh, or if a refresh occurs, the site has built in routing to the Login page for protection.</li>
<li>Login times can be a little slow. If you login and press submit and nothing happens, wait a few seconds - this part is a little slow and has taken me up to 5 seconds. Sorry!</li>
<li>When editing a post sometimes you will have to navigate away then back to posts to see an update.</li>
<li>There is as significant amount of conditional rendering on this site. Some buttons & features will only appear to logged-in users. Please play around with the login functionality to view the full site.</li>
